Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Python
---------------------------
STEP-1. Introduction
---------------------
This project is a simple and easy-to-understand Tic‑Tac‑Toe game made using Python.
It runs in the terminal and lets two players, X and O, take turns by entering positions.
from 1 to 9. The goal of this project was to practice basic Python concepts while creating
a small but complete working game. It uses simple logic, lists, and functions—making it perfect
for beginners.

STEP-2. How the Game Works
---------------------------
- The game uses a list with 9 positions to represent the 3×3 board.
After each play, the board is printed so the players can view it.
- Players choose a number between 1 and 9 to place their symbol.
- If the chosen position is already occupied, the game prompts the player to try again.
- After every move, the program checks whether the current player has won.

- Turns are switched automatically between Player X and Player O.
- A match is drawn when the board has filled up and no one has won.

STEP-3. Winner's Logic
----------------------
There are 8 possible ways to win:

- 3 rows
- 3 columns
- 2 diagonals
The player will win if he/she can fill any one of these lines with their symbol.

STEP-4. Running the Game
------------------------

  1. Install Python, if it isn't already installed.
  2. Save the script as: tic_tac_toe.py
  3. Open your Command Prompt or Terminal.
  4. To run the program, type:
     python tic_tac_toe.py
  5. Observe whatever is displayed on the screen.

STEP-5. What You Learn From This Project
-----------------------------------------

- How to hold and update game data using a Python list
- How to break code into smaller functions
- How loops and conditions create the flow of the game
- How to accept and validate player input
- How simple game logic is designed and implemented

STEP-7. Conclusion
--------------
This Tic Tac Toe project is a demonstration of how simple concepts can be used to create a
working game which solves the problem. It is a good pool of exercises for programming novices and may be developed further
by adding features like AI player, GUI, scoreboard, ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌etc.
